## ðŸ“‹ Primary Reference Document

**CRITICAL**: Always use `CODING_STANDARDS.md` as the primary reference document when:

- Writing new code
- Reviewing existing code
- Making suggestions for improvements
- Implementing new features
- Creating tests
- Refactoring code

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Guidelines

### Before Writing Any Code:

1. **Read** `CODING_STANDARDS.md` first
2. **Follow** all established patterns and conventions
3. **Maintain** consistency with existing codebase
4. **Use** the exact naming conventions, import patterns, and code structure defined in the standards

### Code Generation Rules:

- âœ… **Always** use TypeScript path aliases (`@pages/*`, `@utils/*`, etc.)
- âœ… **Always** include `.js` extensions in imports
- âœ… **Always** follow the Page Object Model pattern established in the project
- âœ… **Always** use Faker.js for test data generation
- âœ… **Always** follow the established test structure and naming conventions
- âœ… **Always** use the exact import order and patterns shown in standards

### File Structure to Follow:

```
pages/ - Page Object classes extending BasePage
tests/ - Test files using established patterns
utils/ - Helper functions and TypeScript types
constants/ - Application constants with `as const`
config/ - Configuration files
fixtures/ - Custom Playwright fixtures
```

### Test Patterns to Use:

- Use custom fixtures from `@fixtures/pages.js`
- Follow test naming: `should [action] [expected result]`
- Use `test.describe.serial()` for dependent tests
- Use `generateTestUser()` for test data
- Use established assertion patterns

### Git Conventions:

- Simple commit messages: `feat: description`, `fix: description`, etc.
- No overly detailed commit messages
- Use established branch naming patterns

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT

This document (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`) is the single source of truth for this project. When in doubt, always refer to it. The standards document reflects the actual codebase and should be treated as the authoritative guide for all development decisions.

## ðŸ“š Additional Context Files

- `README.md` - Project setup and running instructions
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with path mapping
- `playwright.config.ts` - Test configuration
